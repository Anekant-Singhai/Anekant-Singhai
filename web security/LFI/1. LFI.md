There is a difference between the file-read and file inclusion  when when we do the file inclusion , the file is executed rather than being read by the browser
### Scenario 1: 
direct calling

### scenario 2:
When prefix is added by itself
sometimes the page includes it's own path first like this:
![[Pasted image 20230801192439.png]]
Then we have to give it the relative path to the directory like this:

### scenario 3:
Adds a particular extension:

for the php files , we can just remove the .php from behind but for other files , what to do , the code looks like this:

The error changes when we add null byte: 
![[Pasted image 20230801193156.png]]
but alas old versions of PHP allow reading like this , so how to test? -> place the code in the bwapp vulnerable application's in /var/www/bWAPP folder and call it and try it
