this article really helped .... really:
`https://www.baeldung.com/linux/solve-shared-object-error`
there are some variables where linux looks for libraries , like the `_LD_LIBRARY_PATH_`Â Variable

I used this: `ldconfig -p` and grep the filename it was missing:

# clarity
look at the response header log4j
![[CTF/METActf/IMG/Pasted image 20230910014408.png]]
yep it's log4j when read about JNDI in the challenge
so we go to this

# mathe magical
when I give a double quote after the equation , it breaks
