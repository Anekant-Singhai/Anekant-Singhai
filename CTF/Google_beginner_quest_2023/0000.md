Solution was rot13 {caeser cipher}
`Anyway, Caesar was a skilled communicator, and he used a variety of methods to keep his messages secret from his enemies. One of these methods was the Caesar cipher, a simple technique to obfuscate communications. FLAG{rotate_that_alphabet}`

`The Vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. It is a more sophisticated version of the Caesar cipher, which uses a single shift value to encrypt the entire message. FLAG{get_viggy_with_it}`

This was the frequency based , where we need to analyze the text for max frequent letters occuring and the flag was given , so ANSU -> FLAG so substituted them in the first place and then substituted the most occuring with E as E is the most occuring letter , then things started to make sense , It's just like `hangman` game:

`THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.THIS TEXT IS A PANGRAM, WHICH MEANS THAT IT CONTAINS ALL 26 LETTERS OF THE ENGLISH ALPHABET. THIS MAKES IT IDEAL FOR FREQUENCY ANALYSIS, AS THE CRYPTANALYST CAN COMPARE THE FREQUENCY OF LETTERS IN THE CIPHERTEXT TO THE KNOWN FREQUENCY OF LETTERS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
`FOR EXAMPLE, THE MOST COMMON LETTER IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS E. IF THE MOST COMMON LETTER IN THE CIPHERTEXT IS X, THEN THE CRYPTANALYST CAN ASSUME THAT X IS LIKELY TO BE A SUBSTITUTION FOR E.
`OTHER COMMON LETTERS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE INCLUDE T, A, O, I, N, S, AND H. THE CRYPTANALYST CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO MAKE EDUCATED GUESSES ABOUT THE OTHER SUBSTITUTIONS IN THE CIPHERTEXT.
