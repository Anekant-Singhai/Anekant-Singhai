We have our creds and break into the account , we see that we can change the email of our user and we need to login as carlos as said in the description with the password list given to us:
we first look at the bruteforce if it is protected by it or not:
Looks like it is :
![[walkthroughs/Portswigger/Authenication/images/Pasted image 20230827151446.png]]
so we need to bypass it , we need to see what the server is using as to identify the attempts
we tried:
* different password every time we were blocked
* different name 
* different both
* we removed certain headers too, we also changed user-agent
* after being blocked we gave right creds
* we used headers like: XFF , XF....
Not worked
we observe that when we give the wrong creds 3 times we get blocked and when we give the right password after 2 times wrong it gets reset , we created a wordlist for that stuffing wiener , peter after 2 times:
with this code:
```python
import sys

def append_words(input_file, output_file, word):
    with open(input_file, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        for i, line in enumerate(lines):
            file.write(line)
            # Insert the word after every n lines
            if i % 2 == 0 and i != len(lines)-1 :  # Replace n with the desired number of lines
                file.write(word + '\n')

    # Remove the last line if it contains the same word
    with open(output_file, "r+") as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
        if lines[-1].strip() == word:
            file.seek(0)  # Move the file pointer to the beginning of the file
            file.writelines(lines[:-1])  # Write all lines except the last line

    print(f"Word '{word}' appended to alternate lines in '{output_file}'.")

if len(sys.argv) >= 4:
    input_file = sys.argv[1]
    output_file = sys.argv[2]
    word = sys.argv[3]

    append_words(input_file, output_file, word)
else:
    print("Usage: python script.py <input_file> <output_file> <word>")

```
and start the attack:
