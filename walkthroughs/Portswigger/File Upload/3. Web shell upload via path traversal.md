when we upload the file it says:
![[walkthroughs/Portswigger/File Upload/IMG/Pasted image 20230811234804.png]]
and then displays the code rather than executing
so we need to find a file other than this one. This lab has dir. traversal vuln also
we try this:
![[walkthroughs/Portswigger/File Upload/IMG/Pasted image 20230811231844.png]]
It still shows:
![[walkthroughs/Portswigger/File Upload/IMG/Pasted image 20230811234947.png]]
but never interprets ../ as file traversal , so we can encode it: `..%2f`
![[walkthroughs/Portswigger/File Upload/IMG/Pasted image 20230811235054.png]]
![[walkthroughs/Portswigger/File Upload/IMG/Pasted image 20230811235105.png]]
Now when we call the file:
`/files/payload1.php`
![[walkthroughs/Portswigger/File Upload/IMG/Pasted image 20230811235141.png]]
