***
This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It doesn't perform any validation on the files users upload before storing them on the server's filesystem.
To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

There was a file upload functionality:
one on our profile too when we login:

It gets uploaded in:
![[walkthroughs/Portswigger/File Upload/IMG/Pasted image 20230811145520.png]]
we can open it in a new tab to see hwere it went:

let's try some malicious file with malicious contents:
![[walkthroughs/Portswigger/File Upload/IMG/Pasted image 20230811154851.png]]
we get the RCE on `phpinfo()` as it loads the file content on the browser
we give the command:
`syste('cat /home/carlos/secret')`

we can do the same here too:
