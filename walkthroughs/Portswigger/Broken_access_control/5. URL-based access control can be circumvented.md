This website has an unauthenticated admin panel at `/admin`, but a front-end system has been configured to block external access to that path. However, the back-end application is built on a framework that supports the `X-Original-URL` header.
To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete the user `carlos`.

Approach:
#### Broken access control resulting from platform misconfiguration

Some applications enforce access controls at the platform layer by restricting access to specific URLs and HTTP methods based on the user's role. For example an application might configure rules like the following:
`DENY: POST, /admin/deleteUser, managers`
This rule denies access to the `POST` method on the URL `/admin/deleteUser`, for users in the managers group. Various things can go wrong in this situation, leading to access control bypasses.
Some application frameworks support various non-standard HTTP headers that can be used to override the URL in the original request, such as `X-Original-URL` and `X-Rewrite-URL`. If a web site uses rigorous front-end controls to restrict access based on URL, but the application allows the URL to be overridden via a request header, then it might be possible to bypass the access controls using a request like the following:
`POST / HTTP/1.1 X-Original-URL: /admin/deleteUser ...`

Here we have no creds , and the admin panel is right here:
