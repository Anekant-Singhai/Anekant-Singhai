`admin:coffeestains` is the creds for the admin account

we have 3 users:

![[walkthroughs/Vulnhub/Breach_1/IMG/Pasted image 20230926004903.png]]
also when we go to: `modules -> protector -> prefix manager` we can see some backups , just click on backup and repost it , then the page will look like this:
![[walkthroughs/Vulnhub/Breach_1/IMG/Pasted image 20230926005753.png]]
we got this:
![[walkthroughs/Vulnhub/Breach_1/IMG/Pasted image 20230926005822.png]]
we have their hash too in the file

### content:
remember the key we got from the above mail in peter gibbons ? :
well inside the modules -> content -> contents

tried to use that key directly , but it didn't work -> so looked up and found this blog:
`https://programmers-dump.blogspot.com/2011/04/exporting-private-key-from-java.html`
it requires a password -> tomcat maybe
strings keystore:
![[walkthroughs/Vulnhub/Breach_1/IMG/Pasted image 20230926011415.png]]

we use keystore to check what type of key is this:
`keytool -list -v -keystore key` password: `tomcat`
![[walkthroughs/Vulnhub/Breach_1/IMG/Pasted image 20230926011544.png]]
`It must be changed to PKCS12Â format` says the last line via:
```
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore key -destkeystore key.p12 -deststoretype pkcs12
```
we import this to wireshark
also we would need port for it :
we can do this via: statistics -> protocol hierarchy -> transport layer == apply as filter:
![[walkthroughs/Vulnhub/Breach_1/IMG/Pasted image 20230926012713.png]]
then add the rsa key in it to decrypt it:
in the: `edit -> preferences -> protocols -> TLS`

look at the traffic:
![[walkthroughs/Vulnhub/Breach_1/IMG/Pasted image 20230926014243.png]]
`tomcat` and `s3cret`
also look at this: cmd execution!!!
