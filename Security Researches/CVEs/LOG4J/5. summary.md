#### Summary

In summary, this course covered both aspects of understanding the Log4J vulnerability: we successfully exploited it to gain leaked information and RCE, and then we successfully mitigated the threat of it by using the vulnerability to exploit the system and patch it at the same time. With all vulnerabilities, understanding both the exploit and mitigation makes sense for both Blue Teams and Red Teams, as it will prepare both sides to do what they do best - mitigate risk to the enterprise or system. After finishing this course you should feel confident in your understanding of CVE-2021-44228!
