# LOG4J

### **Course Objectives:**

- Explain what the “Log4J Vulnerability” is and which CVE is associated with the vulnerability
- Describe the root cause of the vulnerability
- Perform exploitation of the vulnerability with publicly available exploit code
- Demonstrate how to detect whether the exploit was used and take steps to mitigate the vulnerability

### **What is the Log4J Vulnerability?**

The recent Log4j Vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228), also known as “Log4Shell”, is a vulnerability impacting a massive number of systems. The vulnerability itself is dependent upon a critical logging component of most Apache web application products. By exploiting this aspect of a web application, attackers are able to leak data or even gain remote code execution (RCE) on systems.

Because the Log4J logging package can enable your system to log activity and put those logs into databases and so forth, it ends up being a connection of sorts to other parts of your system. It also works with something else in Java called the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) that enables "message lookups" of data in other services and servers like LDAP or RMI, where logging messages provided to the logging functionality could trigger lookups of the variables provided. Log4J's critical vulnerability arises from a lack of input sanitization being done by the JNDI lookups with a special syntax. Because this information was not being validated/sanitized, attacker-provided variables could be resolved (or considered valid), which ultimately resulted in JNDI doing URI queries, or simply termed, web resource queries.
#### Why is Log4J vulnerable?
- Unsanitized input

In this course, we'll show you how to exploit this vulnerability, and then, in a fun twist, we will use the vulnerability to “exploit” the system and patch it at the same time in our mitigation lab!

### **CVE-2021-44228**

The Log4j Vulnerability was first publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021, with the highest possible CVSS score of 10(!). Due to the absolute minimal access needed to communicate with the system via this vulnerability and the ability to leak valuable data or execute code, the vulnerability was listed as Critical. Typically, for these types of vulnerabilities, patching is recommended. This is because ample time is given by the research team disclosing it to the software vendor, which can then issue a patch. Unfortunately, in this case, the vulnerability was disclosed prior to patching. Thus it was a true “zero-day” (or, zero days since patched) vulnerability.

The vulnerability first gained attention when a user on github named “tangxiaofeng7” disclosed it on their repo. This repo has been removed, but the original link was: [https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7/apache-log4j-poc/](https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7/apache-log4j-poc/). After the exploit code was released, the issue quickly gained steam and soon flared up across SOCs around the world. Matthew Prince, Cloudflare’s CEO, [confirmed](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1469800951351427073) exploitation began on Dec. 1, 2021. There is, however, [evidence](https://github.com/nice0e3/log4j_POC/) that the exploit was available as far back as March 3, 2021.

Log4J is a critical component for most Java-based application logging, and thus, it is ubiquitous with nearly all web application instances using the functionality. One key point to remember is that when we say “web application” we are not only referring to applications that are web facing, but also applications that are using web stack technologies (such as LAMP/WAMP stacks, or Linux/Apache/MySQL/Php, Windows/Apache/MySQL/Php). With all of this in mind, it should be clear as to why this vulnerability is so critical: we live in a web application-based world, and thus, it is everywhere in most of the products we use. If you look at the list of impacted vendors and instances in the link section, you will probably see products that surprise you (Tesla, Steam) and products that do not surprise you (Adobe, Cisco), which should illustrate this point fully. And, as we said before, because input can be entered into a web application and go unsanitized, attackers can exploit this vulnerability in a number of ways.

When looking at code for our Java applications, the simplest way to verify if we have the vulnerability is to look at the actual imports for the application. We do not have the java runtime command variable presented; but suffice it to say, if we have access to the code and recursively grep the code base for log4j library imports, we should be able to identify whether we have a potential vulnerability.

In the following screenshot, (using the vulnerable application from [https://github.com/christophetd/log4shell-vulnerable-app](https://github.com/christophetd/log4shell-vulnerable-app)) you can observe the import of “log4j.LogManager” and “log4j.Logger” in the java code for the “MainController.java” file, indicating that Log4J is present.
